# The-discovered-internet

This is a list of "darknets," or anonymity networks, wireless mesh networks, and P2P networks that we currently know of (and where to 
download the software from). 
If you have knowledge of others, please comment on report section or go for a pull request.
# Solid 
[Solid](http://solid.inrupt.com/) Solid was created by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Its mission is to reshape the web as we know it. Solid will foster a new breed of applications with capabilities above and beyond anything that exists today.
# Tor 
[Tor](https://torproject.org)  (The Onion Router) is a well known anonymity network that disguises your identity by routing your web traffic through a worldwide series of relays and nodes. It also gives you the ability to host "Tor hidden services" built on top of the network, known as ".onion sites."
# I2P 
[I2P](https://geti2p.net) is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network. It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.
I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the average person.
No network can be "perfectly anonymous". The continued goal of I2P is to make attacks more and more difficult to mount. Its anonymity will get stronger as the size of the network increases and with ongoing academic review.
I2P is available on desktops, embedded systems (like the Raspberry Pi) and Android phones. Help spread the word!

# dn42 
[dn42](https://dn42.net/Home) is a big dynamic VPN, which employs Internet technologies (BGP, whois database, DNS, etc).

Data access becomes independent from location, application and storage, enabling in-network caching and and anchor-less mobility. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. These concepts are known under different terms, including but not limited to: Content-Centric Networking (CCN), Named Data Networking (NDN), the network of information (Netinf) and Publish/Subscribe Networking (PSIRP). 
# WING (Wireless Mesh Network for Next-Generation Internet) 
[WING](http://www.wing-project.org/) is an open-source Wireless Mesh Networking platform aimed at hobbyists and enthusiasts.

Multiple radio interfaces support delivers improved spatial reuse and enhanced system throughput. An interference and traffic aware channel assignment algorithm is used in order to dynamically assign the operating frequencies.

No need of configuration, mesh boxes works out of the box. Nodes automatically detect whether they are relays or gateways.

Internet connectivity is provided by the Mesh Gateways using either wired or wireless links. Three tiers deployments are supported allowing connectivity to be provided using using point-to-multipoint wireless links.

WING implements several QoS enhancements aimed at improving the voice capacity of the system and at providing performance isolation among competing flows in noisy environments. Traffic differentiation is provided by means of a multi-queue system based on the DiffServ framework
